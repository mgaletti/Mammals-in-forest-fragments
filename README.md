# Mammals in forest fragments
Analyses of alfa, beta diversity and species turnover in a series of forest landscapes from 5 to 100% cover. G. Beca sampled each landscape with 8 cameras (Bushnell) during 30 consecutive days.

The paper can be cited as:
Beca, Gabrielle, et al. "High mammal species turnover in forest patches immersed in biofuel plantations." Biological Conservation 210 (2017): 352-359.

The dataset is composed of species richness in each landscape (forest cover).
